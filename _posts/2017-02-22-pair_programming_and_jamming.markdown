I come from a background of music. Listening to it, appreciating it, and pushing music in all of its forms was a career I consider myself lucky to have had in a now previous life.

But what was more important to me before I ever got involved in the industry itself was actually just the music. And when I think about what got me into deep into the music - it wasn’t just the listening and appreciating that drew me in. It was the playing. More importantly, it was the jamming.

There are few things in life that can compare to the experience of playing music live with other people. It’s one thing to have a moment by yourself in a room after spending hours writing out parts exactly the way you want them to sound. It’s another thing entirely to step outside of your own physical boundaries and metaphorical walls to play in a room together with someone else.

Music is intrinsically expressive and is therefore not always the easiest thing to do. Even if you have the technique down, there are days and emotions that often get in the way of what one tries to attain when playing. It’s difficult enough to achieve a moment of pure inspiration on your own, but when you have to deal with someone else’s idiosyncrasies to get there, it’s often that much more of a challenge.

But in the end, if you are able to hit that stride, it’s all worth it. Whatever frustration you may have been feeling gets lifted. There’s something beautiful that overcomes when you recognize the music that you’re hearing - what is enveloping you, and inspiring you to move, is at the same time what you are actually creating and contributing to in that given moment.

In that moment, you become one with something larger than yourself. You find yourself making sounds you would have never explored alone in your room. You find yourself learning new techniques or tricks on your instrument. You find the more you let go, the more you are able to become it and make it at the same time. It’s a moment of expression, sharing, vulnerability, growth, and exploration. And this feeling can only be attained by working together with someone other than yourself.

And while I was surprised to have found a very similar feeling in what’s known as pair programming, in retrospect, it makes perfect sense. My QWERTY keyboard may as well be a piano that I spend hours teaching myself how to use every day. My knowledge of methods so far is really just another to describe the instrumental technique that I’ve practiced. My formatting style and workflow are actually more like my means expression. 

Working with someone else in a pair programming setting gets ideas flowing. It gets me to learn new things at a much more rapid pace. I’ve even been able to hit a fugue state working on a very basic CLI app I got inexplicably passionate about. Hours passed and I didn’t even realize it because I was so involved in what I was doing.

My point is, what drew me into music, my undying passion in life, was playing live. But I think what I’m finding now with programming is that my love of music might can easily be transferred. The creation, and collaboration and team effort put out to achieve a common goal is what matters. What matters is hitting that stride with someone other than yourself. Rare is the case that we get somewhere farther than we would have on our own. In other words, what I’m recognizing as one of the most fun and amazing aspects of programming is pair programming otherwise known as the jam.
